# Odoo 11 Development Essentials - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Odoo 11 Development Essentials - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/odoo-11-development-essentials-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788477796), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Odoo continues to gain momentum throughout the world in providing the best platform for open source ERP installations. Now, with Odoo 11, you have access to an improved GUI and performance optimization, integrated in-app purchase features, and a fast-growing community to help transform and modernize your business. With this practical guide, you will cover all the new features that Odoo 11 has to offer to build and customize business applications, focusing on the publicly available Community Edition.

Beginning with setting up a development environment, this book will guide you through a practical journey to build feature-rich business applications. With the aim of jump-starting your Odoo proficiency level, from no specific knowledge to application development readiness, you will develop your first Odoo application. You will move on to topics such as models and views and understanding and using server APIs to add business logic, thus laying a solid foundation for advanced topics.

The book concludes with a guide to Odoo interaction and how to use the Odoo API from other programs, all of which will enable you to efficiently integrate applications with other external systems.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
  'data': [
    'security/ir.model.access.csv',
    'views/todo_menu.xml',
    'views/todo_view.xml',
    ]
```

Other than being familiar with programming, no particular knowledge is expected to be able to take advantage of this book.

Odoo is built using the Python programming language, so it is a good idea to get solid knowledge of it. We also choose to run Odoo in an Ubuntu host, and will do some work on the command line, so it will help to be familiar with it.

To get the most out of this book, we recommend that you find complementary readings on the Python programming language, Ubuntu/Debian Linux operating system, and the PostgreSQL database.

While we will run Odoo in an Ubuntu host (a popular cloud hosting option), we will provide guidance on how to set up our development environment in a Windows system with the help of VirtualBox. Of course, working from an Ubuntu/Debian system is also a possible choice.

All the required software is freely available, and the instructions on where to find it will be given.
